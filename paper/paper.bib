	abstract = {Circumstellar disks play a key role in the understanding of stellar systems. Direct imaging of such extended structures is a challenging task. Current post-processing techniques, first tailored for exoplanets imaging, tend to produce deformed images of the circumstellar disks, hindering our capability to study their shape and photometry in details. We address here the reasons of this shortcoming and propose an algorithm that produces more faithful images of disks taken with ground-based telescopes. We also show that our algorithm is a good candidate for exoplanets imaging. We then explain how our approach can be extended in the form of a regularized inverse problem.},

	abstract = {High-contrast adaptive optics imaging is a powerful technique to probe the architectures of planetary systems from the outside-in and survey the atmospheres of self-luminous giant planets. Direct imaging has rapidly matured over the past decade and especially the last few years with the advent of high-order adaptive optics systems, dedicated planet-finding instruments with specialized coronagraphs, and innovative observing and post-processing strategies to suppress speckle noise. This review summarizes recent progress in high-contrast imaging with particular emphasis on observational results, discoveries near and below the deuterium-burning limit, and a practical overview of large-scale surveys and dedicated instruments. I conclude with a statistical meta-analysis of deep imaging surveys in the literature. Based on observations of 384 unique and single young (\${\textbackslash}approx\$5--300{\textasciitilde}Myr) stars spanning stellar masses between 0.1--3.0{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}Msun, the overall occurrence rate of 5--13{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}Mjup {\textbackslash} companions at orbital distances of 30--300{\textasciitilde}AU is 0.6\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\}\_\{-0.5\}\${\textbackslash}\% assuming hot-start evolutionary models. The most massive giant planets regularly accessible to direct imaging are about as rare as hot Jupiters are around Sun-like stars. Dividing this sample into individual stellar mass bins does not reveal any statistically-significant trend in planet frequency with host mass: giant planets are found around 2.8\${\textasciicircum}\{+3.7\}\_\{-2.3\}\${\textbackslash}\% of BA stars, \${\textless}\$4.1{\textbackslash}\% of FGK stars, and \${\textless}\$3.9{\textbackslash}\% of M dwarfs. Looking forward, extreme adaptive optics systems and the next generation of ground- and space-based telescopes with smaller inner working angles and deeper detection limits will increase the pace of discovery to ultimately map the demographics, composition, evolution, and origin of planets spanning a broad range of masses and ages.},

	abstract = {Angular differential imaging is a high-contrast imaging technique that reduces quasistatic speckle noise and facilitates the detection of nearby companions. A sequence of images is acquired with an
altitude/azimuth telescope while the instrument field derotator is switched off. This keeps the instrument and telescope optics aligned and allows the field of view to rotate with respect to the instrument. For each image, a reference point-spread function (PSF) is constructed from other appropriately selected images of the same sequence and subtracted to remove quasistatic PSF structure. All residual images are then rotated to align the field and are combined. Observed performances are reported for Gemini North data. It is shown that quasistatic PSF noise can be reduced by a factor {\textasciitilde}5 for each image subtraction. The
combination of all residuals then provides an additional gain of the order of the square root of the total number of acquired images. A total speckle noise attenuation of 20-50 is obtained for a 1 hr long observing sequence compared to a single 30 s exposure. A PSF noise attenuation of 100 was achieved for a 2 hr long sequence of images of Vega, reaching a 5 σ contrast of 20 mag for separations greater than 8". For a 30 minute long sequence, ADI achieves signal-to-noise ratios 30 times better than a classical observation technique. The ADI technique can be used with currently available instruments to search for
{\textasciitilde}1MJup exoplanets with orbits of radii between 50 and 300 AU around nearby young stars. The possibility of combining the technique with other high-contrast imaging methods is briefly discussed.

approach provides comparable suppression to the Locally Optimized

to the algorithm parameters and speed enhancement. For characterization
of detected sources, the method enables forward modeling of
astrophysical sources. This alleviates the biases in the astrometry and
photometry of discovered faint sources, which are usually associated
with LOCI-based PSF subtractions schemes. We illustrate the algorithm
performance using archival Hubble Space Telescope images, but the
approach may also be considered for ground-based data acquired with
angular differential imaging or integral-field spectrographs.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05170},
	abstract = {Imaging circumstellar disks in the near-infrared provides unprecedented information about the formation and evolution of planetary systems. However, current post-processing techniques for high-contrast imaging have a limited sensitivity to extended signals and their morphology is often plagued with strong morphological distortions. Moreover, it is challenging to disentangle planetary signals from the disk when the two components are closed or intertwined. We propose a pipeline that is capable of detecting a wide variety of disks and preserving their shapes and flux distributions. By construction, our approach separates planets from disks. After analyzing the distortions induced by the current angular differential imaging (ADI) post-processing techniques, we establish a direct model of the different components constituting a temporal sequence of high-contrast images. In an inverse problem framework, we jointly estimate the starlight residuals and the potential extended sources and point sources hidden in the images, using low-complexity priors for each signal. To verify and estimate the performance of our approach, we tested it on VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS data, in which we injected synthetic disks and planets. We also applied our approach on observations containing real disks. Our technique makes it possible to detect disks from ADI datasets of a contrast above \$3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$ with respect to the host star. As no specific shape of the disks is assumed, we are capable of extracting a wide diversity of disks, including face-on disks. The intensity distribution of the detected disk is accurately preserved and point sources are distinguished, even close to the disk.},

NMF is an iterative approach, which first creates a nonorthogonal and non-negative basis of components using the given reference images and then models a target with the components. The constructed model is then rescaled with a factor to compensate for the contribution from the disks. We compare NMF with existing methods (classical reference differential imaging method, and the
Karhunen-Loève image projection algorithm) using synthetic
circumstellar disks and demonstrate the superiority of NMF: with no need of prior selection of references, NMF not only can detect fainter circumstellar disks but also better preserves their morphology and does not require forward modeling. As an application to a well-known disk example, we process the archival Hubble Space Telescope STIS
coronagraphic observations of HD 181327 with different methods and compare them, and NMF is able to extract some circumstellar materials inside the primary ring for the first time. In an appendix, we
mathematically investigate the stability of NMF components during the iteration and the linearity of NMF modeling.},
