This means all the positions for apertures, bounds, images, etc. start at 1. This is distinct from 0-based indexing in python, but is equivalent to the indexing in DS9 and IRAF.\nJulia's std uses the sample statistic (n-1 degrees of freedom) while numpy's std uses the population statistic (n degrees of freedom). This may cause very slight differences in measurements that rely on this.\nAperture mapping - many of the Metrics are derived by measuring statistics in an annulus of apertures. In VIP, this ring is not equally distributed- the angle between apertures is based on the exact number of apertures rather than the integral number of apertures that are actually measured. In ADI.jl the angle between apertures is evenly distributed. The same number of pixels are discarded in both packages, but in VIP they all end up in the same region of the image (see this figure).\nCollapsing - by default VIP collapses a cube by derotating it then finding the median frame. In ADI.jl, the default collapse method is a weighted sum using the inverse of the temporal variance for weighting.

Rather than hard-coding in PCA, the GreeDS algorithm was written generically, and Julia's multiple-dispatch  allows the use of, say, NMF instead of PCA.

The goal of HCI is to probe the circumstellar regions of a star in the search for companions, debris disks, and more. The use of large aperture telescopes, adaptive optics (AO), and coronagraphs are the basis of HCI. An example of an image taken with these instruments is shown below.","category":"page"},{"location":"introduction/","page":"Introduction to HCI","title":"Introduction to HCI","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"introduction/","page":"Introduction to HCI","title":"Introduction to HCI","text":"What is notable in this image is that there is a lot of structured noise in the image that is overwhelming any potential companion signal. The center of the image is particularly noisy, which is precisely where we are most interested in searching for exoplanets. This noise is the effect of quasi-static speckles in the focal-plane. These speckles occur from non-common path aberrations in the AO system and are a fundamental part of the data received by these instruments. Improving the quality of instrumentation is an active topic of HCI research, but it is beyond the scope of this introduction.","category":"page"},{"location":"introduction/#adi","page":"Introduction to HCI","title":"Angular Differential Imaging (ADI)","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"introduction/","page":"Introduction to HCI","title":"Introduction to HCI","text":"Because this noise is fundamental to the data, post-processing must be performed in order to see any circumstellar signal.

The exoplanet is still sitting below the statistical noise in this frame, but the noise can be averaged out by combining many frames together. Since we are concerned with subtracting the speckles, we need to be careful and consider how do we fit and subtract the speckles without removing potential companion signal?","category":"page"},{"location":"introduction/","page":"Introduction to HCI","title":"Introduction to HCI","text":"This is where angular differential imaging (ADI) comes in. ADI is an observational technique pioneered in the early 2000s as an extension of roll deconvolution for ground-based telescopes. The core of this process is that the quasi-static speckles are a function of the optical system, not the astrophysical source. Throughout a night of observing we can leverage the rotation of the Earth to make the field-of-view (FOV) appear to rotate (on an Alt-Az mounted telescope with the field rotator disabled). Even though the sky appears to rotate, because the speckles are due to the telescope optics they will not appear to rotate. The animation below shows a cube of data with a bright fake companion that illustrates the sky rotation typical of ADI.","category":"page"},{"location":"introduction/","page":"Introduction to HCI","title":"Introduction to HCI","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"introduction/","page":"Introduction to HCI","title":"Introduction to HCI","text":"By taking this sequence of images (commonly referred to as a cube) we can more easily model and fit the speckle signal separate from any companions. If you median combine the cube as-is, the non-stationary companion signal will attenuate leaving just the speckles. If we derotate the sequence according to the parallactic angles for each frame we align the sky to a common heading. Now we can collapse the derotated sequence and the planet will constructively interfere while the now-rotating speckles will attenuate. The figure below shows these two competing reductions.","category":"page"},{"location":"introduction/","page":"Introduction to HCI","title":"Introduction to HCI","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"introduction/#Post-Processing-Algorithms","page":"Introduction to HCI","title":"Post-Processing Algorithms","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"introduction/","page":"Introduction to HCI","title":"Introduction to HCI","text":"Using data cubes (as described in the ADI section), we are tasked with fitting the speckles without capturing the rotating companion signal.
