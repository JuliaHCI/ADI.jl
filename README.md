A package for angular differential imaging (ADI) post-processing algorithms.

## Installation

ADI.jl is a registered package and can be installed using the Julia package manager. From the Julia REPL, enter Pkg mode (by pressing `]`)

```julia
julia>]

(@v1.5) pkg> add ADI
```

To exit Pkg mode, just backspace. Once the package is installed it can be imported with

```julia
julia> using ADI
```

To exit Pkg mode, just backspace. Once the package is installed it can be imported with
For more information, see the [Pkg documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/).

## Usage

The following is an extremely brief PCA reduction of an ADI cube. Please see the [documentation](https://juliahci.github.io/ADI.jl/dev/) for further usage, tutorials, and api reference.

```julia
julia> using ADI

julia> cube, angles = # load data

julia> alg = PCA(ncomps=10)

julia> flat_resid = alg(cube, angles) # ADI

julia> flat_resid_rdi = alg(cube, angles, cube_ref) # flexible RDI
```

get the S/N and significance

```julia
julia> fwhm = # PSF fwhm in pixels

julia> snmap = detectionmap(snr, flat_residual, fwhm)

julia> sigmap = detectionmap(significance, flat_residual, fwhm)
```

get the contrast curve

```julia
julia> psf = # load psf or choose from HCIToolbox.Kernels

julia> cc = contrast_curve(alg, cube, angles, psf; fwhm=fwhm)
```

which can be easily loaded into a `DataFrame` or anything adopting the Tables.jl interface.

```julia
julia> using DataFrames

julia> df = DataFrame(cc)

julia> head(df)
```

**Author's Note**: This package is still under active development and is subject to change. Anything from minor behind-the-scenes details to large-scale design can change as I incorporate more methods into ADI.jl. I don't plan on spending much time with deprecation warnings throughout this process, since that limits my ability to experiment with implementation ideas and design goals. This package follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), so an upgrade from `0.6` to `0.7` may be breaking and I recommend anybody using this package to browse the release notes for changes. Once ADI.jl is somewhat stable, I'll release a version `1.0`, at which point I'll worry about deprecations and other long-term usability considerations.
